  <sec:Security_Problem_Description>
	<h:p>A Network Device has a network infrastructure role that it is designed to provide. In doing so,
	the Network Device communicates with other Network Devices and other network entities (i.e.
	entities not defined as Network Devices because they do not have an infrastructure role) over
	the network. At the same time, it must provide a minimal set of common security functionality
	expected by all Network Devices. The security problem to be addressed by a compliant
	Network Device is defined as this set of common security functionality that addresses the
	threats that are common to Network Devices, as opposed to those that might be targeting the
	specific functionality of a specific type of Network Device. The set of common security
	functionality addresses communication with the Network Device, both authorized and
	unauthorized, the ability to perform valid and secure updates, the ability to audit device activity,
	the ability to securely store and utilize device and Administrator credentials and data, and the
	ability to self-test critical device components for failures.</h:p>

users of the same system.

<sec:Security_Requirements>
	<h:p>The individual security functional requirements are specified in the sections below. SFRs in
	this section are mandatory SFRs that any conformant TOE must meet. Based on selections
	made in these SFRs it will also be necessary to include some of the selection-based SFRs in
	Appendix B. Additional optional SFRs may also be adopted from those listed in Appendix A. </h:p>

	<h:p>For a distributed TOE, the ST author should reference Table 1 for guidance on how each SFR
	should be met. The table details whether SFRs should be met by all TOE components, by at
	least one TOE component or whether they are dependent upon the feature being implemented
	by the TOE component. The ST for a distributed TOE must include a mapping of SFRs to each
	of the components of the TOE. (Note that this deliverable is examined as part of the
	ASE_TSS.1 and AVA_VAN.1 Evaluation Activities as described in [SD, 5.1.2] and [SD,
	5.6.1.1] respectively. </h:p>

	<h:p>The Evaluation Activities defined in [SD] describe actions that the evaluator will take in order
	to determine compliance of a particular TOE with the SFRs. The content of these Evaluation
	Activities will therefore provide more insight into deliverables required from TOE Developers.</h:p>

    <sec:Security_Assurance_Requirements>
      The Security Objectives in 
      <xref to="Security_Objectives"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
      <xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)
      in <xref to="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <h:br/> This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      <!--(AAs). Never use these again --> to be performed are specified both in <xref to="SFRs"/>
      as well as in this section. <h:br/> The general model for evaluation of OSs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:br/> After the
        ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
        OS, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <xref to="SFRs"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <xref to="SFRs"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP.
      <section title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">As per ASE activities
        defined in <xref to="bibCEM"/>.</section>
      <section title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the OS is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the TSS portion of the ST. The OS developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in <xref to="SFRs"/> should provide the ST authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.
          <a-component cc-id="adv_fsp.1" name="Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)">The
          functional specification describes the TSFI. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because OSs conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by OS
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

              AGD_PRE documentation. The developer may reference a website accessible to application
              developers and the evaluator. The assurance activities in the functional requirements
              point to evidence that should exist in the documentation and TSS
              section; since these are directly associated with the SFRs, the tracing in element
              ADV_FSP.1.2D is implicitly already done and no additional documentation is

              done by the OS or the underlying platform. The evaluator will
              verify that this process includes the following steps: Instructions for obtaining the
              update itself. This should include instructions for making the update accessible to
              the OS (e.g., placement in a specific directory). Instructions for
              initiating the update process, as well as discerning whether the process was
              successful or unsuccessful. This includes generation of the hash/digital signature.
              The OS will likely contain security functionality that does not
              fall in the scope of evaluation under this PP. The operational guidance shall make it

              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in

              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform. <h:br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting

    this PP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the OS or its underlying
    platform) are contained in the body of this PP. There are additional requirements based on
    selections in the body of the PP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements
    below will need to be included. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This appendix includes requirements that
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently
    mandated in the body of this PP as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the
    OS is still conformant to this PP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
    possible. </appendix>
